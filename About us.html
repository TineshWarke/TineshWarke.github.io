Infoplease is a reference and learning site, combining the contents of an encyclopedia, a dictionary, an atlas and several almanacs loaded with statistics, facts, and historical records. Our editors regularly update and refine this enormous body of information—as well as adding new discoveries and identifying trends—to bring you reliable and authoritative information. The content is written and edited by professional editors, and the site has received numerous awards and accolades since launch. Parents, teachers and librarians turn to Infoplease for information on an array of topics, including current events, pop culture, science, government and history. They can also confidently point students and children to our COPPA and kidSAFE-certified sister site, Fact Monster, assured that it's a safe place for kids to explore.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<h3>
Infoplease.com is the most recent step in a nearly hundred-year journey to educate and engage the public. From our days as a radio quiz show to our current form, we’ve made it our goal to answer people’s questions and to encourage curious minds.

<h2>Our Editors, Authors & Advisors</h2>
<h3>
The editors at Infoplease wear a lot of hats. We work as researchers, fact-checkers, editors, and writers. All of our editors come from publishing backgrounds, especially textbook publishing. We aren’t industry experts and science whizzes who just pull things from memory; we’re dedicated writers with training and experience in researching and verifying data, and in getting that info out into the world. That’s why we put a premium on our sources, as we get into below. However, we know that those whizzes and experts inspire their own kind of confidence. That’s why, moving forward, Infoplease is exploring bringing on advisors to enrich our content. Check back in the future to see how our content grows and evolves.
