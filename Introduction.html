<h1>What is football?</h1>
<h2>
Association football more commonly known as football or soccer, a sport played between 2 slides of 11 <br>
players with a spherical ball. Football is the worlds most popular sport.<br><br>

Outfield players move the ball with any part of the body except their hands or arms,whilst the ball is <br>
in play. Only the goal keeper can use their hands and this is only in their penalty area. When the ball<br> 
goes out of play at either side of the pitch an opposing player from the side which did not put the ball<br>
out of play can throw the ball back into play using their hands. Both feet must remain on the floor <br> 
behind the throw line. Both hands must remain on the ball until it is released from behind the throwers <br> 
head.<br><br>

The object of football is to outscore your opponents. A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the <br> 
goal line between the goal posts. A draw is when both teams score the same amount of goals during the <br> 
allotted time.<br><br>
